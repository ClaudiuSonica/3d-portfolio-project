# 3D Portfolio Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for transforming the current portfolio website into a 3D navigable experience using Three.js. The goal is to create an immersive 3D environment where users can navigate between different sections of the portfolio without scrolling, using keyboard arrows or mouse controls.

- [x] Set up basic camera and controls
- [x] Create a development environment for testing

## 3D Environment Design
- [x] Design the overall 3D space layout
  - [x] Decide on a theme (space, abstract, geometric, etc.)
  - [x] Plan the positioning of different sections
  - [x] Design transitions between sections
- [x] Create 3D models or use primitives for section representations

  - [x] Projects section representation (right cube)
  - [x] About section representation (left cube)
  - [x] Contact section representation (back cube)
- [x] Design lighting and atmosphere

## Navigation System
- [x] Implement keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
  - [x] Forward/backward movement
  - [x] Left/right movement
  - [x] Optional: Up/down movement
- [x] Implement mouse navigation
  - [x] Click and drag for looking around
  - [x] Optional: Mouse wheel for zoom
- [x] Create a navigation UI
  - [x] Section indicators (where the user is currently)
  - [ ] Visual indicators for available directions
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between sections

## Content Integration
- [x] Create a system for displaying content in 3D space
  - [x] HTML overlays for text content
  - [x] 3D representations for visual content
- [x] Adapt existing components for 3D display
  - [x] Hero section content
  - [x] Projects display
  - [x] About me information
  - [x] Contact form
- [x] Implement interaction with content elements
  - [x] Clickable content
  - [x] Visibility based on current section
  - [x] Proper cleanup of resources

## Visual Effects
- [x] Add particle systems for atmosphere
- [ ] Implement post-processing effects
  - [ ] Bloom for highlights
  - [ ] Depth of field
  - [ ] Optional: Motion blur
- [x] Add animations for elements
  - [x] Idle animations (rotating particles)
  - [x] Interaction animations (section visibility)
  - [ ] Transition animations
- [ ] Create custom shaders for unique effects

## Performance Optimization
- [x] Implement performance detection and quality adjustment
  - [x] Detect device capabilities
  - [x] Adjust particle count based on performance
  - [x] Optimize renderer settings for different devices
- [x] Optimize rendering pipeline
  - [x] Adjust pixel ratio based on performance
  - [x] Disable antialiasing on low-end devices
  - [x] Use appropriate shadow map types
- [x] Optimize animations
  - [x] Integrate particle animation into main loop
  - [x] Reduce unnecessary calculations

## Testing & Refinement
- [x] Implement responsive design
  - [x] Create responsive content sizing system
  - [x] Adjust dimensions based on screen size
  - [x] Handle window resize events
- [ ] Test on different devices and browsers
- [ ] Gather feedback on navigation experience
- [ ] Refine controls based on feedback
- [ ] Final polish and bug fixes

## Implementation Approach
1. Start with a basic navigable 3D environment
2. Add simple representations of each section
3. Implement basic navigation between sections
4. Gradually enhance visual quality and effects
5. Integrate actual content from existing components
6. Refine navigation and interactions
7. Add final polish and optimizations

## Timeline Estimates
- Basic 3D scene setup: 1 day
- Navigation system implementation: 2 days
- Section representations: 2-3 days
- Content integration: 3-4 days
- Visual effects and polish: 2-3 days
- Testing and refinement: 2 days

Total estimated time: 12-15 days
