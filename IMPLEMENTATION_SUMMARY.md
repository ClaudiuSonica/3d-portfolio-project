## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **ThreeScene.vue**: Main 3D scene container with WebGL and CSS3D renderers
- **ThreeDContent.vue**: Component for displaying HTML content in 3D space

### Performance Optimization
The implementation includes automatic quality adjustment based on device capabilities:
- **Low-end devices**: Fewer particles, disabled antialiasing, basic shadows
- **Mid-range devices**: Medium particle count, medium quality settings
- **High-end devices**: Full particle count, high quality settings

### Responsive Design
Content sizing is automatically adjusted based on screen dimensions:
- **Mobile**: 90% width (max 500px), 70% height (max 600px)
- **Tablet/Small Desktop**: 70% width (max 700px), 80% height (max 700px)
- **Large Desktop**: 60% width (max 800px), 80% height (max 800px)
